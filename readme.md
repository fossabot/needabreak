NEED A BREAK! is an open source application intended to help you take care of your health while you work on a computer. 
It will encourage you to regularly have a break in order to rest your back and your eyes.

I have made it for my personal usage and personaly use it every day at work and it helps me to not sit for too long. So I decided to share it because maybe it could be useful to someone else.

Here are some screen shots of the UI :

# Installation
If you just want to install the latest version of the application, you can download it [here](https://bnobo.github.io/needabreak/NeedABreak/publish/setup.exe).

Alternatively you can download an installer from the [releases](https://github.com/bNobo/needabreak/releases) page.

> Note that you will have a big red warning during installation because the installer is not digitally signed.

# Get started
The project is a WPF application targeting .Net Framework 4.5.2. All you need is a copy of Visual Studio Community in order to build it.
Once started, the application creates a coffee cup icon in the task bar to manifest its presence and permits user to interract with it. 
Just click on the coffee cup to open the application menu.

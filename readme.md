# NEED A BREAK!

## Presentation

NEED A BREAK! is an open source application intended to help you take care of your health while you work on a computer.
It will encourage you to regularly have a break in order to rest your back and your eyes.

I have made it for my personal usage and personaly use it every day at work and it helps me to not sit for too long. So I decided to share it because maybe it could be useful to someone else.

You will be notified a minute before lockdown:

When it is time to have a break a countdown will appear. The screen will be locked when it reaches 0:

You can verify that the application is running thanks to the task bar icon:

You can display the application menu by clicking on the coffee cup:

The settings window let you choose how long the application will wait before lockdown:

## Installation

If you just want to install the latest version of the application, you can download it [here](https://bnobo.github.io/needabreak/NeedABreak/publish/setup.exe).

> Note that you will have a big red warning from the UAC during installation because the installer is not digitally signed.

## Get started

The project is a WPF application targeting .Net Framework 4.8. All you need is a copy of Visual Studio Community in order to build it.
Once started, the application creates a coffee cup icon in the task bar to manifest its presence and permits user to interact with it. 
Just click on the coffee cup to open the application menu.

## Points of interest in code

### P/Invoke

Use of P/Invoke to lock workstation:

```csharp
[DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true)]
[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
static extern bool LockWorkStation();
```

Use of P/Invoke to check current user notification state in order to automatically suspend the application if a notification would not be appropriate:

```csharp
[DllImport("shell32.dll")]
static extern int SHQueryUserNotificationStte(outUserNotificationStateuserNotificationState);
```

### System events

Use of system events to detect session switch:

```csharp
Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.SessionSwitch += SystemEvents_SessionSwitch;
```

### Mutex

Use of Mutex class to prevent application from beeing launched twice:

```csharp
mutex = new System.Threading.Mutex(false, "Local\\NeedABreakInstance");
if (!mutex.WaitOne(0, false))
{
    Logger.Info("Application already running");
    Current.Shutdown();
    return;
}
```

### Translations

Use of [Multilingual App Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MultilingualAppToolkit.MultilingualAppToolkit-18308) extension to handle translations. RESX files are automatically generated from translations made in XLF files.

Use of custom markup extension to handle translations in XAML files like this:

```XAML
<TextBlock Margin="0 210 0 0"
           Text="{utils:TextResource warranty}" />
```

### Adorner

Use of Adorner class to surround selected tile on the settings window.
